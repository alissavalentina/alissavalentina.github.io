The theme I have decided to go with is an Iceberg/Water theme. 
The atmosphere of being under the water and falling deeper into the ocean is what I am trying to convey
Using blues, reds, and yellows that are often seen in sailor outfits. 
Using breezy fonts and easy to read ones will help to convey the atmosphere of relaxation.
Having the background image as the iceberg with animations will convey the "under the sea" kind of look. 

Two Alternate Ideas:
    1. Having coloumns and rows of photos alternating with text that would either flip of fade when hovered over.
    2. Toliet paper with checkered background where the toliet paper moves as you scroll.
